This repository is home to a set of email filters that
I use to automatically sort all the college emails that I get.

How it works
============

Emails will get automatically sorted into a `gmail label <https://support.google.com/mail/answer/118708>`__ called "Colleges"
and be `archived <https://support.google.com/mail/answer/6576>`__ to keep the out of the inbox.

.. warning::

   This filter will also filter all emails from a `.edu` email address and may cause unwanted issues.

This technically contains two filters at the moment to catch all the emails.

Installing
==========

Installing is easy:

#. Download the filters from `here <https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Blendify/college-filters/master/mailFilters.xml>`__
   Download the files by right clicking and select *Save As...*
#. Open Gmail's email filters editor by going to :menuselection:`Settings --> Filters and Blocked Addresses`
#. Install the filters:

   #. Use :guilabel:`Import filters` then select :guilabel:`Choose File`
      use this to download the file downloaded earlier.
   #. After selcting the file use :guilabel:`Open file` to import the filters.
   #. Finally you can use :guilabel:`Apply new filters to existing email`
      and finish with :guilabel:`Create filters`
#. Your college emails will now be sorted
